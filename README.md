### Try find secrets locations!

##### Cloned repository (new domain!)

##### How to use
```
This adventure starts with the fact that you can see the first location right away,
you will also have access to hints and carefully read the description of the secret place!
When you find the first location, there will be a QR-code on the spot that you can scan,
and then you will open secret location 2, when you find it,
scan the QR-code and see where secret location 3 is.
Take a selfie with secret location 3 and send it to me!
